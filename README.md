# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# TASKMASTER
Prompt:
"Develop a React Vite app named Taskmaster with the following functionality and features:

Core Features:

1. Add Task:

Allow users to add tasks with a description, date, and time using input fields and a 'Add Task' button.



2. Edit Task:

Users should be able to update the task description, date, and time. Provide an 'Edit' button for each task.



3. Delete Task:

Include a 'Delete' button to remove tasks from the list.



4. Mark Task as Complete:

Users should be able to mark tasks as completed with a 'Complete' button. Completed tasks should have a visual indication (e.g., strikethrough or different color).



5. Countdown Timer:

Display a countdown timer for each task, showing the time left until the task's due date and time. Update the timer dynamically.




User Interaction:

Use buttons, input fields, and a form for task management.

Provide meaningful feedback, such as success messages after task creation or error messages for invalid input (e.g., missing description or date).

Add animations or smooth transitions for actions like adding, deleting, or editing tasks.


Additional Features:

Display the total number of tasks and how many are completed.

Allow sorting or filtering tasks (e.g., by due date or completion status).

Save tasks in localStorage to persist data across page reloads.


Technical Details:

Use React with Vite for project setup and bundling.

Manage the application state using React hooks like useState and useEffect.

Use setInterval or similar methods to update the countdown timers in real-time.

Style the app using  TailwindCSS, Ensure the app is responsive and visually appealing.


The final app should be intuitive, interactive, and provide a seamless experience for managing tasks."
